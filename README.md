# Heart Attack Prediction

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack in individuals based on health-related attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and other medical factors. Using machine learning models, the system analyzes patient data to identify high-risk cases, providing an early warning mechanism for preventive healthcare.

The project is designed as a **college mini-project**, demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation.
